# Sentiment_Analysis_on_Reviews
Sentiment analysis using pipelines on an Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset involves using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and summarize the sentiments expressed in the reviews. Here's a general overview of the process using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK
1. Data Preparation:
   ->Load the Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset
2. Text Preprocessing:
   ->Tokenize the text into individual words.
   ->Remove stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text.
   ->Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
3. Feature Extraction:
   ->Convert the text data into numerical format using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
4. Model Building:
   ->Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or train your own model using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Training the Model:
   ->Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
T  ->Train the sentiment analysis model using the training data.
6. Evaluation:
   ->Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
